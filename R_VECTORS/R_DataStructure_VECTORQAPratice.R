# Vector Pratice

#1. Using the c() function, create a vector with the following values: 7, 22, -9, 14, 6.
answer1Vector1 <- c(7, 22, -9, 14, 6)
answer1Vector1

#2. Create a vector that repeats four times the vector created at the exercise #1.
answer1Vector2 <- 

#3. Create a vector that repeats four times the vector created at the exercise #1,
#   element-wise.

#4. Create a vector that contains a sequence of 30 numbers between 1 and 100.

#5. Create a vector that contains a sequence of numbers between -5 and 55, with a
#step of 2.

#6. Create a vector that contains the sequence created at #4, plus the following
# components: 73, 39 and 99.

#7. Create a vector that contains two sequences of integers: the first one from 4 to
#12 and the second one from 38 to 20.

#8. Create a vector of 10 discrete random numbers between 1 and 70, with and
#without replacement.

#9. Create a vector of 30 discrete random numbers between 25 and 145, with and
#without replacement.

#10.Create a vector of 100 discrete random numbers between 3 and 9.
